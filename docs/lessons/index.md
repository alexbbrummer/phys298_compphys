# Lessons (Tuesdays)

Tuesdays are “talk + build” days:
- We introduce the physics idea + computational skill.
- We live-code a short script (Spyder cells).
- The script is posted under **Notes (rendered)** as a browsable page.

Tip: If you’re looking for what to *do*, start with the matching Thursday lab.
