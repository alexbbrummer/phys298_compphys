# Week 2 (Thu) — Lab 2: 1D kinematics; read data; compute v,a; plot

## In-class plan
- Work through the tutorial script cell-by-cell.
- Fill in **TODO** sections.
- Produce the required plots.

## Notes (rendered tutorial)
- [Week 02 Thu lab notes](../notes/week-02-thu.ipynb)

## What to submit (becomes HW)
- A completed `.py` file (your solution)
- Plots saved to `png` (or embedded in a short PDF)

## Extension questions (optional / challenge)
