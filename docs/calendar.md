# Calendar (Weeks 1–10)

This is the pre-project plan. Project weeks begin in Week 11.

| Week | Tuesday (Concept & Skill Building) | Thursday (Paired Programming Lab → HW) |
|---:|---|---|
| 1 | Intro to computational physics; environment; syntax; variables; simple I/O | Lab 1: First steps; basic calculations; translate formulas into code |
| 2 | Data structures; plotting; example: constant-acceleration plots | Lab 2: 1D kinematics; read data; compute v, a; plot with units |
| 3 | Control flow: conditionals + loops; example: projectile max height | Lab 3: Projectile motion; with/without drag; integrate Newton’s 2nd law |
| 4 | Functions; modular code; documentation | Lab 4: E&M superposition; point charges; vector field plots |
| 5 | Linear algebra: Ax=b; solving with libraries | Lab 5: Circuit analysis with Kirchhoff + `linalg.solve`; testing/validation |
| 6 | ODE integration: Euler, Euler–Cromer; stability/error | Lab 6: SHO; compare methods; energy conservation |
| 7 | Runge–Kutta + library solvers; `solve_ivp` | Lab 7: Damped/driven oscillator; phase space; resonance/chaos |
| 8 | Coupled ODE systems; normal modes; eigenproblems | Lab 8: Coupled oscillators; eigensystem; mode shapes |
| 9 | Model fitting + optimization; least squares; uncertainty | Lab 9: Fit falling-object data; linear vs quadratic drag |
| 10 | Randomness + Monte Carlo ideas | Lab 10: Radioactive decay sim; histogram + exponential fit |
